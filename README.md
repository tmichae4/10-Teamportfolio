# 10-Teamportfolio# Team Portfolio Generator

<h1>Project 10</h1>
<p>This project is to create an application that will help develop teams to generate a portfolio
of their employees to display their basic information such as name, id, email, and another information based on their job title.</p>

<h2>The Steps</h2>
<p>
I created a parent element called "Employee" which I then extended to the child elements "Engineer", "Intern", and "Manager".

I then ran tests using the "npm run test" command in the integrated terminal to make sure that they were all working together and were true extensions of the Employee element.

I then created the parameters I would include in the command line questionaire that would help us create our squads portfolio, within the index.js file.

The I worked to create an html which would  apply the information passed through the command line questionnaire and generate the data in an organized and viewable manner.

Then once you run "node index.js", after answering the prompts, and was able to generate a web page that included all of my teams data in a neat and organzied manner, also applying a css bootstrap link to make it look cleaner and organize the data.</p>
